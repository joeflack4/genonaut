description: Provide a handoff summary of what we worked on, but don't instruct to do any work.
---

I'm having trouble compacting you, so can you write me a prompt to hand-off to you that dooesn't instruct you to do 
anything, but simply is a good summmary of everything you've done and any current problems you are aware of in regards
to what we have been working on in this session / conversation? My goal is that I'll bring your memory back in the 
/history of our conversation, to a part where you were at a low context usage, and then I'll give you this summary, and
it'll load you up with good context (low token usage) so that we can continue where we left off.
