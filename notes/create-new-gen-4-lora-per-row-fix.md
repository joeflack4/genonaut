# What the model said last time:
Perfect! I've fixed both issues:

  Changes made:

  1. Fixed maximum 4 LoRAs per row:
    - Added explicit breakpoints: lg={3} xl={3}
    - This ensures that on all screen sizes from medium onwards, each LoRA takes
  exactly 3 out of 12 columns (25% width), allowing exactly 4 per row
    - The 5th LoRA will now wrap to a new row below
  2. Fixed width variations:
    - Made Grid item use display: 'flex'
    - Made inner Box use flex: 1 instead of height: '100%'
    - Added minWidth: 0 to prevent flex overflow issues
    - Added display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' to the Box to ensure proper
  vertical stacking

  The LoRA cards will now:
  - Show exactly 4 per row on medium+ screens
  - All have equal widths (no variation)
  - The 5th LoRA will appear on a second row below the first 4

# However, the problem remains
