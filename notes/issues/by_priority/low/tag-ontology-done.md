# Tag ontology: Completed tasks
## Success Criteria

- [x] Foundation ready for future OWL conversion and SPARQL querying

## Questions for User (answered)

1. **Database Access**: Should I proceed with creating mock data for initial development, or do you have specific database credentials/environment I should use?
A: Use the real tags in the demo database, in the content_items and content_items_auto tables.

2. **Hierarchy Scope**: What level of granularity should we target? (e.g., very broad categories vs. detailed sub-classifications)
A: Every tag should have a spot in the hierarchy. As granular as possible.

3. **Root Categories**: Do you have preferences for top-level ontology categories? (e.g., visual_style, object_type, subject_matter, artistic_medium, etc.)
A: The root of every .owl hierarchy is owl:thing. But other than that, you can pick the categories. They will probably be abstract. So perhaps actually multiple roots (each one subclass of owl:thing) are fine, each with their own tree, and it is ok if something appears in multiple trees.

4. **Manual vs Automatic**: How much of the initial hierarchy creation should be automated vs. manually curated?
A: If there is some software library to automate it in a programmatic way, like using NLP in some way, that miht be nice. But basically I am relying on you to think about the relationships. You will be the curator.

5. **Future Integration**: Are there specific SPARQL query patterns you envision using once this is converted to OWL?
A: Not yet.
