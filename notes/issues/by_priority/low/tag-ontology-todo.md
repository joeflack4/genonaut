## Frontend "Mobile experience" Tasks (@skipped-until-TBD)
### Touch Interaction Patterns
- [ ] Large touch targets (min 44px) for expand/collapse
- [ ] Swipe gestures for horizontal scrolling in deep trees
- [ ] Touch-and-hold for context menus on nodes
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh for hierarchy updates

### Layout Adaptations
- [ ] Collapsible search bar to save vertical space
- [ ] Bottom sheet modal for tag details/actions
- [ ] Simplified tree view with better spacing
- [ ] Horizontal scroll indicators for deep branches

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for long lists on mobile
- [ ] Lazy loading of tree branches
- [ ] Reduced animations for better performance
- [ ] Optimized touch event handling

### Mobile-Specific Features
- [ ] Voice search for tag names
- [ ] Haptic feedback for tree interactions
- [ ] Gesture-based navigation shortcuts
- [ ] Offline support for previously loaded trees

### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- [ ] Mobile: < 768px - Single column, simplified UI
- [ ] Tablet: 768px-1024px - Compact tree with side panel
- [ ] Desktop: > 1024px - Full featured tree view
