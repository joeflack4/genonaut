# ComfyUI Fixes - Task List

## Tags
N/A

## Phase 1: Understanding Current Implementation

- [x] Read MockComfyUIServer implementation
- [x] Read ComfyUIClient implementations (API and Worker)
- [x] Read workflow integration code (generation service, tasks)
- [x] Identify discrepancies between mock and real ComfyUI API

## Phase 2: Fix POST /prompt Response

### 2.1 Update Mock Response Structure
- [x] Add `number` field to POST /prompt response (should be 0)
- [x] Add `node_errors` field to POST /prompt response (should be {})
- [x] Add test to verify POST response structure matches real ComfyUI
- [x] Run tests and verify they pass

## Phase 3: Implement Delayed Processing

### 3.1 Add Time Tracking to Jobs
- [x] Add `submitted_at` timestamp to job records in MockComfyUIServer
- [x] Add configurable delay parameter (default 0.5 seconds)
- [x] Update `get_history` to check elapsed time before auto-processing

### 3.2 Fix In-Progress Response
- [x] Update `get_history` to return `{}` when job is still queued/running (before delay)
- [x] Update `get_history` to return full response only after delay has elapsed
- [x] Add test that checks status before delay completes (should get `{}`)
- [x] Add test that checks status after delay completes (should get full response)
- [x] Run tests and verify they pass (10/10 basic tests passing, 44+ integration tests passing)

## Phase 4: Fix History Response Structure

### 4.1 Update Response Format
- [x] Add `prompt` field to history response (containing workflow details)
- [x] Update `status` structure to include `status_str` field ("success" or "failed")
- [x] Keep existing `completed` and `messages` fields
- [x] Add `meta` field to match real ComfyUI response structure
- [x] Update test assertions to verify new structure
- [x] Run tests and verify they pass (44 passed, 17 skipped)

## Phase 5: Verify Backend Integration

### 5.1 Check Backend Code
- [x] Verify `get_workflow_status` in comfyui_client.py handles new response structure
- [x] Verify `get_output_files` correctly extracts file paths from outputs
- [x] Check if any code depends on old response structure
- [x] Update any code that needs changes to work with corrected mock (no changes needed)

### 5.2 Integration Testing
- [x] Test full workflow: submit job - check while running (get {}) - check after complete
- [x] Test that `collect_output_paths` correctly extracts paths from mock response
- [x] Test that `organized_paths` is correctly populated
- [x] Verify no "Unable to determine primary image path" errors occur
- [x] Run full test suite and verify all tests pass (44 ComfyUI tests + 4 API integration tests passing)

## Phase 6: Documentation and Cleanup

### 6.1 Documentation
- [x] Add docstring comments explaining delay behavior
- [x] Document the response structure in MockComfyUIServer
- [x] Add example usage in docstrings
- [x] Update README if needed (no changes required - mock server is internal testing infrastructure)

### 6.2 Final Verification
- [x] Run full backend test suite: `make test-api` (104 passed, 55 skipped)
- [x] Run unit tests: `make test-unit` (133 passed, 8 skipped)
- [x] Run database tests: `make test-db` (64 passed)
- [x] Ensure all tests pass or are properly skipped (345 total tests passing!)

## Summary of Changes

### Mock Server Updates
1. **POST /prompt Response**: Added `number` and `node_errors` fields to match real ComfyUI API
2. **Processing Delay**: Implemented 0.5-second configurable delay to simulate real processing
3. **History Response Format**: Updated to match real ComfyUI structure with:
   - `prompt`: [number, prompt_id, workflow, extra_data, output_nodes]
   - `status`: {status_str, completed, messages}
   - `outputs`: {node_id: {images: [{filename, subfolder, type}]}}
   - `meta`: {node_id: {node metadata}}
4. **In-Progress Handling**: Returns `{}` when job is still processing (< delay threshold)

### Test Updates
1. Updated tests to wait for processing delay before checking completion
2. Fixed timeout test to account for poll_interval (2.0s) + processing delay (0.5s)
3. All 44 ComfyUI integration tests passing

### Backend Compatibility
- No changes needed to backend code (comfyui_client.py, comfyui_generation_service.py)
- Backend already correctly accesses normalized response fields
- All workflows continue to function correctly

### Test Results
- Unit tests: 133 passed, 8 skipped
- Database tests: 64 passed
- API integration tests: 104 passed, 55 skipped
- ComfyUI integration tests: 44 passed, 17 skipped
- **Total: 345 tests passing**
