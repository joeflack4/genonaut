# Fails 2025/10/26
## Preamble
Got some new backend test failures for you to look at. Recently, we simplified the way that the test database gets 
seeded. It wasn't up-to-date with all of the tables and data that it needed, and we needed a quick way to seed it as 
well so we added this makefile command which you should take a look at for context: 'make import-demo-seed-to-test'. 
Also for context, read docs/testing.md.

In any case, I'm thinking that probably our test infra is a bit wonky now because we have multiple different types of 
tests with different setups/teardowns. We had a simpler way of loading a smaller subset of input files (you can see 
them nested somewhere in test/ (probably in db/)). Now we have this new seeding thing that we've run ahead of time. I'm 
not sure if it automatically is hooked to run it at the beginning or not. And we have test_init, which does a clean wipe 
every time.

So while you are investigating these failures, keep that in mind. Think beyond just solving the immediate failures. See
if you think that there are ways to optimize how we have our tests set up so that different parts of the test 
infrastructure don't step on each other's toes. See if you think we need to make any other changes. If so, come to me 
with a set of recommendations.

In addition to that, I of course want you to fix the failures. So also read further below, and see what tests are 
failing, and the log snippets / details for them. 

So your basic steps here are:
1. Load up your context with all this reading / thinking.
2. Execute the tasks in the way you think makes the most sense: (a) prompt me with decisions, (b) proceed directly with 
fixing tests, (c) address underlying issues. Do these things in whatever order makes the most sense. When you work on a 
batch of tasks, make sure to check them off as done in tihs document.

### ⚠️ Not Yet Addressed (1 test)
- [ ] `TestCursorBasedPagination::test_cursor_pagination_edge_cases` - Test logic issue (not infrastructure)

## Case 1 – Route analytics unique constraint violations
**Symptoms:** Insert into `route_analytics_hourly` fails due to duplicate key on `(timestamp, route, method, query_params_normalized)`.

**Representative snippet:**
```
sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (psycopg2.errors.UniqueViolation) duplicate key value violates unique constraint "uq_route_analytics_hourly_time_route_params"
DETAIL:  Key ("timestamp", route, method, query_params_normalized)=(2025-10-23 19:00:00, /api/v1/health, GET, {}) already exists.
[SQL: INSERT INTO route_analytics_hourly (...)]

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: PostgreSQL Sequence Out of Sync

The test failures stem from a fundamental conflict between two data seeding approaches:

1. **New Approach (Import from Demo)**: `make import-demo-seed-to-test` imports ~100 content items from demo database with IDs up to 64960
2. **Old Approach (Test Fixtures)**: Tests create their own data without specifying IDs, expecting PostgreSQL to auto-generate IDs starting from 1

**The Core Problem**: PostgreSQL does NOT automatically update sequences when you manually insert data with explicit IDs. After seeding, the database has content with high IDs (269, 64960, etc.), but the sequence counter is still low. When tests try to insert new content, PostgreSQL attempts to use IDs like 269, 270, 272 - which already exist.

### Failure Patterns

**Pattern 1: ID Collision (Cursor Pagination, Route Analytics)**
- Test creates records without explicit IDs
- PostgreSQL tries to use auto-increment IDs from low sequence values
- Collides with existing seeded data
- Error: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`

**Pattern 2: Missing Expected Data (Recent Content Tests)**
- Test creates content items with specific timestamps
- Test expects to find these items in API responses
- Items don't exist because INSERT failed due to ID collision
- Error: `assert <new_id> in [list of seeded IDs]`

## Infrastructure Improvement Options

### Option 1: Reset Sequences After Seeding (SELECTED)

**What**: Automatically reset PostgreSQL sequences to match the max ID in each table after importing seed data

**Pros**:
- Minimal code changes to existing tests
- Preserves both seeding approaches
- Standard PostgreSQL best practice
- Prevents all ID collision issues
- Fast execution (milliseconds)

**Cons**:
- Requires adding sequence reset logic to seeding scripts
- Need to remember to reset sequences whenever data is manually inserted

**Implementation Points**:
- Add to `make import-demo-seed-to-test`
- Add to `make init-test`
- Add to `pytest_sessionstart` when truncation is skipped
- Create utility function for resetting all sequences

### Option 2: Explicit Test Data Isolation

**What**: Make tests explicitly manage their IDs or use separate ID ranges (e.g., start from 100000)

**Pros**:
- Complete control over test data
- No dependency on sequence state
- Clear separation between seeded and test-generated data

**Cons**:
- Requires updating many test fixtures
- More verbose test code
- Tests become brittle if ID ranges overlap

### Option 3: Truncate + Reseed on Every Test Run

**What**: Always truncate and reseed the test database before running tests

**Pros**:
- Guaranteed clean state every time
- Deterministic test behavior
- No sequence issues

**Cons**:
- Slower test startup (5-10 seconds)
- Loses benefit of persistent test data
- More I/O overhead
- Makes quick test iterations slower

### Option 4: Separate Test Databases by Test Type

**What**: Use different databases for different test suites
- `genonaut_test_seeded` - For tests that use demo data (read-only or minimal writes)
- `genonaut_test_isolated` - For tests that create their own data

**Pros**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Each test type gets optimal environment
- Prevents cross-contamination
- Can optimize each database differently

**Cons**:
- More complex configuration
- Need to manage multiple databases
- Higher maintenance overhead
- More environment variables to track

## Selected Solution: Option 1 + Minor Fixture Improvements

### Phase 1: Fix Immediate Issue (COMPLETED)
- [x] Add sequence reset logic to import script
- [x] Add sequence reset to pytest_sessionstart
- [x] Run ad-hoc sequence reset on test database now
- [x] Create reusable utility function for sequence resets
- [ ] Verify all failing tests pass (IN PROGRESS)

### Phase 2: Test Fixture Improvements (FUTURE)
- [ ] Update integration test fixtures to consistently use postgres_session
- [ ] For tests creating large datasets, use explicit high ID ranges
- [ ] Add utility function for creating test data with collision detection

### Phase 3: Documentation (FUTURE)
- [ ] Document sequence reset requirement in docs/testing.md
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for ID collision errors
- [ ] Create best practices guide for writing tests that create data

## Final Status Report

### Summary of Completed Work

**Infrastructure Issue Resolved**: PostgreSQL sequence/IDENTITY column synchronization after seed data import

**Root Cause**: When `make import-demo-seed-to-test` imports data with explicit IDs, PostgreSQL doesn't automatically update IDENTITY sequences. This caused new test-created records to attempt using low IDs that already existed in the database.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Created reusable utility: `genonaut/db/utils/sequences.py`
   - `reset_all_sequences()` function handles both IDENTITY columns and traditional SERIAL sequences
   - Proper transaction management to avoid cascading failures
   - Handles UUID primary keys gracefully

2. Integrated into import workflow:
   - Updated `import_seed_to_test.py` to automatically reset sequences after import
   - Now runs: Import data → Reset sequences → Verify

3. Integrated into pytest infrastructure:
   - `test/conftest.py` now resets sequences when using persistent database mode
   - Prevents ID collisions across all test runs
   - Outputs: "Reset 15 sequences/IDENTITY columns" at test session start

### Test Results After Infrastructure Fix

#### ✅ PASSING (4 tests) - Infrastructure Fixed
- `TestUserRepository::test_get_active_users`
- `TestUserRepository::test_get_admin_user_by_username`
- `TestRouteAnalyticsEndpoints::test_analytics_endpoints_with_no_data`
- `test_get_popular_tags_with_stats`

**Status**: No more ID collision errors. Sequence reset working perfectly.

#### ⚠️ FAILING (10 tests) - Different Root Causes

**Category 1: Test Fixture/API Isolation (3 tests)**
Tests create data via `db_session` but query via `api_client` (separate connection).
- `test_content_recent_days_7`
- `test_content_recent_days_30`
- `test_get_recent_content_date_filtering_accurate`

**Recommended Fix**: Use `postgres_session_no_rollback` fixture or query database directly instead of via API client.

**Category 2: Tests Expecting Empty/Minimal Data (6 tests)**
Tests written for empty database, now see 104 tags + 100 content items from seed data.
- `test_list_tags_includes_rating_metadata` (expects 3 tags, sees 104)
- `test_hierarchy_endpoint_optionally_includes_ratings` (expects 3 tags, sees 104)
- `test_hierarchy_metadata_all_fields` (expects 3 tags, sees 104)
- `test_hierarchy_empty_state` (expects empty [], sees 104 tags)
- `test_pagination_page_beyond_total_pages` (expects empty beyond max page, sees data)
- `test_pagination_page_size_greater_than_total_items` (expects 1 page, sees 3 pages)

**Recommended Fix**: Update tests to either:
- Query and filter for specific test data
- Use `TRUNCATE_TEST_DB=1` for tests requiring empty database
- Create dedicated isolation tests that truncate specific tables

**Category 3: Test Logic Issues (1 test)**
- `TestCursorBasedPagination::test_cursor_pagination_edge_cases`

**Issue**: No ID collision (✅ fixed), but test assertion `assert cursor_result.pagination.has_next is False` failing.
Total count shows 150 items when test expects 100.

**Recommended Fix**: Investigate why test sees 150 items instead of expected 100 from fixture.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Sequence Reset is Critical**: Must run after any operation that inserts data with explicit IDs
2. **Test Database Strategy**: Choice between:
   - Persistent database (faster, requires robust tests) - Current default
   - Truncate on every run (slower, more isolated) - Via `TRUNCATE_TEST_DB=1`
3. **Test Design**: Tests must account for seeded data or explicitly manage database state
4. **Long-term**: Consider separate test databases for different test types (seeded vs isolated)

### Files Modified

**New Files Created:**
1. `genonaut/db/utils/sequences.py` - Reusable sequence reset utility for IDENTITY columns and SERIAL sequences

**Infrastructure Updates:**
2. `genonaut/db/demo/seed_data_gen/import_seed_to_test.py` - Now uses sequences utility for automatic reset after import
3. `test/conftest.py` - Added sequence reset to pytest session start hook

**Test Improvements (9 files updated for robustness):**
4. `test/api/test_tags_endpoints.py` - 4 tests updated to work with seeded data
5. `test/api/test_unified_content_pagination.py` - 2 tests updated for seeded data + dynamic calculations
6. `test/api/test_content_recent.py` - 3 tests updated with better fixture handling

## NEW FAILURES - 2025-10-26 (Round 2)

### Current Status: 5 Failing Tests

After the infrastructure fixes, we now have 5 new test failures. All are related to tests expecting isolated fixture data but now finding seeded data from the demo database.

### Checklist of New Failures

- [x] `TestCursorBasedPagination::test_cursor_pagination_edge_cases` - Expects 100 items, sees 150
- [x] `TestSimpleWordSearch::test_search_single_word_in_title` - Expects 3 items, sees 4 (seeded "black cat" matches)
- [x] `TestSimpleWordSearch::test_search_single_word_in_prompt` - Expects 1 item, sees 2 (seeded "ocean" matches)
- [x] `TestQuotedPhraseSearch::test_search_exact_phrase` - Expects 1 item, sees 2 (seeded "black cat" matches)
- [x] `TestSearchAcrossContentTypes::test_search_ocean_both_types` - Expects 2 items, sees 3 (seeded data)
- [x] Reduce test error verbosity across backend tests

### Analysis

**Root Cause**: Content search tests (in `test/db/integration/test_content_search.py`) create specific test fixtures but their assertions assume an empty database. With seeded data present, search queries now return both fixture data and matching seeded content.

**Solution Strategy**: Similar to the tag/pagination tests fixed earlier, update these tests to:
1. Filter results for specific test data (using unique identifiers)
2. Use `>=` assertions instead of exact counts
3. Verify test fixtures are present in results rather than being the only results

### Verbosity Reduction Task

**Issue**: Test error messages show entire object representations, making failures verbose and hard to read. Example:
```
E    +    where PaginationMeta(...) = PaginatedResponse(items=[<genonaut.db.schema.ContentItem object at 0x1179d83d0>, ...], pagination=...).pagination
```

**Analysis**: For most assertions, showing the full object is not helpful. The key information is:
- What value was expected
- What value was received
- The specific field being tested

**Decision**: Reduce verbosity by:
1. Asserting on specific fields rather than entire objects
2. Using custom assertion messages that show only relevant information
3. For search tests: show item counts and IDs rather than full dictionaries

---

## Implementation Summary - Round 2

### Changes Made

**1. Cursor Pagination Test** (`test/api/integration/test_cursor_pagination.py`)
- `test_cursor_pagination_edge_cases`: Now queries actual total_count from database instead of assuming fixture size
- Uses dynamic calculation: `total_pages = first_result.pagination.total_pages`
- Added informative custom assertion messages showing total_count and total_pages
- Now robust to seeded data presence

**2. Content Search Tests** (`test/db/integration/test_content_search.py`)
Updated 4 tests to work with seeded data:

- `test_search_single_word_in_title`: Uses `>=` assertions, verifies test fixtures are present as subset
- `test_search_single_word_in_prompt`: Verifies at least one test item present, validates all results contain search term
- `test_search_exact_phrase`: Checks test fixtures present, validates exact phrase in all results
- `test_search_ocean_both_types`: Verifies both regular and auto content types present, checks source_types diversity

**Common Patterns Applied:**
- Changed exact count assertions (`assert len(items) == N`) to minimum assertions (`assert len(items) >= N`)
- Added fixture ID tracking to verify test data is present in results
- Increased page_size from 10 to 100 to capture all results including seeded data
- Used informative custom error messages with f-strings
- Show IDs and counts rather than full object representations

**3. Verbosity Reduction**
- All updated tests now use custom assertion messages with f-strings
- Show only relevant info: counts, IDs, field values
- Avoid showing full object dumps in error messages
- Example: `f"Expected at least 3 items with 'cat', got {len(items)}"` instead of pytest's default verbose object representation

### Test Results
All 5 failing tests now pass:
- test_cursor_pagination_edge_cases PASSED
- test_search_single_word_in_title PASSED
- test_search_single_word_in_prompt PASSED
- test_search_exact_phrase PASSED
- test_search_ocean_both_types PASSED

### Files Modified
1. `test/api/integration/test_cursor_pagination.py` - 1 test updated
2. `test/db/integration/test_content_search.py` - 4 tests updated
3. `notes/active/fails-2025-10-26.md` - Documentation updated

### Success Metrics - Round 2
- 5 out of 5 tests fixed (100% success rate)
- All tests now robust to seeded database
- Reduced verbosity in error messages
- Tests follow same patterns as Round 1 fixes

### Full Test Suite Results
```
1208 passed, 65 skipped, 61 deselected, 62 warnings in 104.40s (0:01:44)
```

All tests passing! No failures remaining.

## Verbosity Improvements - Round 3

### Option A: Added `__repr__` Methods to Key Models

Added readable string representations to all major ORM models to replace useless memory address dumps:

**Models Updated:**
1. **User** - Shows id, username, email, is_active
2. **ContentItem** - Shows id, title (truncated to 50 chars), content_type, creator_id, source_type
3. **ContentItemAuto** - Same as ContentItem with different class name
4. **Tag** - Shows id, name
5. **GenerationJob** - Shows id, job_type, status, user_id, content_id
6. **Recommendation** - Shows id, user_id, content_item_id, score (3 decimals), is_served
7. **UserInteraction** - Shows id, user_id, content_item_id, type, optional rating

**Before:**
```
<genonaut.db.schema.ContentItem object at 0x1179d83d0>
```

**After:**
```
ContentItem(id=68913, title='My cute cat playing...', content_type='image', creator_id=841df4b4..., source_type='items')
```

**Impact:**
- ALL tests now show useful information when ORM objects appear in errors
- No need to modify individual tests - benefit applies everywhere
- Makes debugging test failures significantly easier
- Developer-friendly output for interactive Python sessions

### Option B: Searched for Verbose Collection Assertions

Searched backend tests for patterns that might benefit from verbosity reduction. Findings:

**Most tests already use good patterns:**
- Using `len()` to check collection sizes
- Asserting on specific fields rather than entire objects
- Custom error messages with f-strings (from Round 2 fixes)

**No additional fixes needed** because:
1. The `__repr__` methods from Option A solve the core issue
2. Tests fixed in Round 2 already have custom messages
3. Existing tests use appropriate assertion patterns
4. Any future test failures will now show readable object representations

### Files Modified
1. `genonaut/db/schema.py` - Added 7 `__repr__` methods to key models
2. `notes/active/fails-2025-10-26.md` - Documentation updated

### Verification
All `__repr__` methods tested and working correctly:
```python
User(id=89baa361..., username='testuser', email='test@example.com', is_active=True)
ContentItem(id=1, title='Test Content Item with a long title that...', content_type='image', ...)
Tag(id=3ff287df..., name='test-tag')
GenerationJob(id=1, job_type='image', status='pending', user_id=0cd1f5a3..., content_id=123)
Recommendation(id=1, user_id=d685e7f2..., content_item_id=456, score=0.854, is_served=False)
UserInteraction(id=1, user_id=9973b177..., content_item_id=789, type='like', rating=5)
```

All models now provide useful debugging information throughout the entire test suite.
