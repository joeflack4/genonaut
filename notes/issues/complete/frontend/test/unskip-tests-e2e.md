# Candidates for Re-enabling Skipped E2E Tests

## Not Longrunning

**Skipped Tags**
- `@skipped-because-no-rate-limit-ui`: Rate limit specific messaging not yet implemented; form surfaces generic error.
- `@skipped-because-js-error-ui-missing`: No user-visible UI exposed for JavaScript error reporting.
- `@skipped-because-no-progressive-fallback`: Progressive enhancement fallback content not implemented.

### Basic Navigation and Generation Form Tests
