# Thumbnails
## Intro
I'd like to update the "Dashboard" and "Gallery" pages. The content_items are going to all be images. Right now we're 
only showing in list view. We're not displaying any actual images, thumbnails for images, nor placeholders for images.

I want to change that. I want to display thumbnails of images. Right now, the full path of images in the content_items 
and content_items_auto tables resides in the content_data column. I you to add a new field to the model for these tables 
(schema.py): it should be called "path_thumb". This will be the path on disk to the thumbnail. In the future, we will 
have multiple such fields for different resolutions, but for now, just 1 field. After you add this to the model, run the 
`migrate-prep` command to do an auto-migration. Then you can update the demo database with `migrate-demo`. You can try 
the `migrate-dev` too but if it gives you an error that's ok, we're not using that DB right now.

Once that's in place, you should be good to update the API to provide thumbnail data as well.

Then, most of the work is going to be on the frontend. I want to have 2 new icons at the top right of the "Dashboard" 
and "Gallery" pages. The Gallery page already has an icon up there for 'settings' / 'options'. You can put these icons 
to the left of those. One of these icons will be for "list view" (which is what is currently implemented). The other 
will be for "grid view" (AKA "thumbnail view") (what you are going to implement now). Whichever view is active should change the icon color 
so that it appears active.

As a later phase for this, I also want diferent sizes for thumbnails. So you might want a little down arrow next to the 
/ attached to the "thumbnail view" icon, where it pops out a dropdown for the user to select a resolution.

Here are the resolution options:

576 x 768
520 × 698 (≈91% of ref)
480 × 644 (≈84%)
440 × 590 (≈77%)
400 × 537 (≈70%)
360 × 484 (≈63%)
320 × 430 (≈56%)
300 × 403 (≈53%)

Please make "480 × 644" the default resolution for "thumbnail view" when it is selected.

Navigating away and back to these pages should retain state / memory of the current view that is active on that page.

For rendering of images, if the thumbnail is not present, but the full image is present, then render the full image as a
fallback. However, you should shrink its appearance such that it fits into the grid cell. So if the resolution of each 
grid cell is 480 × 644, but the image is 576 x 768, it should dynamically shrink down the image to fit into the cell.

If the user clicks the image, then there should be a new temporary page that opens up, that displays the image in its 
full size, with image metadata beneath it. Hitting back on the navigation should return the user to the Gallery page, 
but there should also be a "back" arrow icon for the user to select to do that navigation too.

The path for the full size imags are in the content_data columns.

Placeholders:
Note that right now, we actually have no images on disk. So we will use placeholders. In these cases if there is no 
thumbnail and no fallback image either, then we will use a placeholder icon. Choose a suitable icon, but when thinking 
about this and drafting the spec, please provide a list of other candidate icons, by name, so I can look at them later.

Get started by drafting a detailed spec in the "Spec" section below. Then, write a very large checklist of tasks that 
you will go through to fully implement this feature. This should have multiple phases, maybe even sub-phases.

If you think that there are important decisions I haven't covered, add them in the "Open Questions" section below, and I 
will answer them and get back to you.

Read `notes/routines/iteration.md`, and follow that routine for doing this work. So the major steps for you are:
1. Write the spec
2. Write the checklist
3. Write any open questions you have for me, if applicable.
4. Based on my answers to those questions (if any), update the spec and the checklist further.
5. Begin work on this, and work continuously, following the SOP in `iteration.md`.

## Open Questions

1. **Image Source Priority**: When both thumbnail and full image exist, should we always use thumbnail, or only in grid 
view? (Assumption: Always use thumbnail when available in grid view, fallback to full image)
A: Yes, I believe that is what I wrote in the intro; that is correct.

2. **Grid Layout**: Should the grid be fixed (e.g., always 4 columns) or responsive based on viewport width? 
(Assumption: Responsive grid based on viewport)
A: Yes, responsive. As I mentioned, the thumbnails / grid cell sizes will be different rsolutions, the default being 
480 × 644. So, the grid should be responsive, each row showing as many such images as will fit in that row for a given 
viewport width. 

3. **Placeholder Icon**: Which icon library should I use? Material-UI icons? (Assumption: MUI icons)
A: Yes, as I believe that is what we are currently using, and there should be suitable icons for that.

4. **Full Image View URL Structure**: Should the full image view be a modal/dialog or a separate route? (Assumption: 
Separate route like `/gallery/:id` for better navigation)
A: Yes, separate route!

5. **localStorage Keys**: What prefix should I use for storing view preferences? (Assumption: `gallery-view-mode` and 
`dashboard-view-mode`)
A: I like those keys. And then for the values, you could store `list` or `grid-WIDTHxHEIGHT`. You can get those values 
from the "resolution options" list above in `notes/thumbs.md`. 

6. **Multiple Resolution Thumbnails**: You mentioned multiple resolutions as a later phase. Should I implement the 
dropdown now with a single option, or just the icon toggle for now? (Assumption: Just icon toggle for now, dropdown in 
later phase)
A: Yeah, I think let's get the main features working first. We can worry about the dropdown later / soon. But it should 
definitely be part of one of the (later) phases in `notes/thumbs.md`.

7. **Image Metadata**: What metadata should be displayed below the full-size image? Title, created date, creator, tags, 
quality score? (Assumption: All of the above)
A: Yes, all of those. And also the prompt!

This is important, and increases the scope (sorry): I haven't added a `prompt` field to the content_items and 
content_items_auto table yet. But we're going to need it there. Please add that field to both of those tables, and use 
the same indexing as is used on that same field that resides currenty in the `generation_jobs` table.

We also need a way to make these `prompt` fields immutable, in the 3 tables: content_items, content_items_auto, and 
generation_jobs. Here is some example SQL that does that kind of thing:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION forbid_prompt_update() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.prompt IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.prompt THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'prompt is immutable';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER trg_forbid_prompt_update_gj
BEFORE UPDATE ON generation_jobs
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION forbid_prompt_update();

CREATE TRIGGER trg_forbid_prompt_update_ci
BEFORE UPDATE ON content_items
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION forbid_prompt_update();
```

So as part of this work, you can go ahead and update the  SqlAlchemy models  /database definitions, e.g. in `schema.py`.
That way, when database is initialized, it will be created. And when we do a migration, it will automatically be 
created. Remember--do NOT make a manual `migrations/versions/` file (one exception: see question 7.2.).

Additional Q&A for question 7:
7.1. Data Type & Size: Should the prompt field be Text (unlimited) like in generation_jobs, or would you prefer a 
VARCHAR with a specific limit?
A: Good question! Let's set it to 20,000. And also apply that limit to the prompt field in generation_jobs as well.

7.2. Nullable or Required: Should prompt be nullable or required (nullable=True vs nullable=False)? I'm thinking it 
should probably be nullable since:
- Existing content items don't have prompts
- Some content might be manually created/uploaded without a generation prompt
Is that correct?
A: Good question. Make them `nullable=False`. The data in the database right now is synthetic demo data. I'm going to 
- recreate it shortly, and I'll make sure that all of them have prompts. Also another good point--good thinking, about 
- manually uploaded content. That won't be allowed for these tables. They will only be for AI generated content. I was 
- just thinkinga bout renaming the tables to "gens" instead of "content" to disambiguate, but I won't do that yet. I'll 
- maybe add a "works" table later, for manual content.

We can do this:
`prompt = sa.Column(sa.String(20000), nullable=False)`

But there will be a problem. I did say not to create manual migrations, but in this case, there is no possible way 
around it, because if it is not nullable, and we add the column, it will error because there are existing rows, and 
there is no default listed, so it can't backfill.

We'll have to follow this workflow to address this issue:
i. run the alembic autogenerate code: `make migrate-prep m="MESSAGE"`
ii. modify that auto-generated script to do the backfilling (see snippet below)
iii. run the migration: `make migrate-demo`, and also `make migrate-dev`, but if that one errors it's ok since we're not 
using that DB.

Here's the kind of snippet you might want to add to step (2). I'm not entirely sure if this is correct, but this is the 
general idea. Of course, there will be 3 tables total; not just content_items.
```py
# inside the autogenerated revision, tweak upgrade() like this

from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

def upgrade():
    # 1) add column nullable with a temporary server default
    op.add_column("content_items", sa.Column("prompt", sa.String(20000), nullable=True, server_default=sa.text("'todo'")))

    # 2) backfill any pre-existing NULLs (belt-and-suspenders)
    op.execute("UPDATE content_items SET prompt = 'todo' WHERE prompt IS NULL")

    # 3) enforce NOT NULL
    op.alter_column("content_items", "prompt", nullable=False)

    # 4) drop the default so future inserts must provide a value
    op.alter_column("content_items", "prompt", server_default=None)

def downgrade():
    op.drop_column("content_items", "prompt")

```

7.3. Default Value: For existing records and future records without prompts, should we use NULL or an empty string ''?
A: Answered by my answer to (7.2). To reiterate: The field is going to be not-nullabe. But we will do a backfill 
peration during the migration.

7.4. Trigger Creation in SQLAlchemy: For the immutability triggers, I see you want them created automatically. SQLAlchemy doesn't have built-in trigger support in model definitions, so I'll need to use DDL event listeners (similar to how pg_trgm extension is created in the current schema). Should I:
- Create the trigger function once globally
- Create separate triggers for each of the 3 tables (generation_jobs, content_items, content_items_auto)
And should this be PostgreSQL-only (like the other triggers), or do we need to support other databases?
A: Create a single forbid_prompt_update() function once, and attach three triggers (one on each of generation_jobs, content_items, content_items_auto) that call it. Implement via SQLAlchemy DDL event listeners, gated to run only on PostgreSQL. This keeps logic DRY and maintainable while applying immutability wherever needed.

7.5. API Updates: After adding the prompt field:
- Should it be included in all content API responses?
- Should there be a way to create/update content items with a prompt (but only on creation, since it's immutable)?
A: By default, not it should not be returned by all tables. We will soon set it up so that the search function will query the prompt (if it doesn't do that already), but it doesn't actually need to return the prompt. Like for example, in the Gallery and Dashboard pages, for all items it shows on each page in the results, it shouldn't have fetched the prompt for all those items. The prompt should only show when clicking one of the entries and viewing the single content item in isolation.

7.6. Frontend Display: Besides showing the prompt on the full image detail page, should it also be visible anywhere else (like in the list view or grid view tooltips)?
A: Per the answer given just now in (5), nope! Just the full image detail page.

8. **Aspect Ratio**: Should grid cells maintain aspect ratio, or should images be cropped/fitted to exact cell 
dimensions? (Assumption: Maintain aspect ratio, fit within cell bounds)
A: Correct assumption!

## Spec

### Overview
Add thumbnail display capabilities to Dashboard and Gallery pages, with two view modes: list view (current) and grid view (new). Grid view will display image thumbnails in a responsive grid layout with configurable resolution options.

### Database Schema Changes

#### ContentItem and ContentItemAuto Models
- **New field**: `path_thumb` (String(512), nullable) - Path to thumbnail image on disk
- **New field**: `prompt` (String(20000), nullable=False) - Generation prompt used to create the content
- Location: `genonaut/db/schema.py` in `ContentItemColumns` class (shared by both tables)
- Future-proof: Designed to support multiple thumbnail fields (e.g., `path_thumb_sm`, `path_thumb_md`, `path_thumb_lg`)

#### GenerationJob Model
- **Update field**: `prompt` - Change from Text to String(20000) to match content item tables

#### Prompt Immutability
- Create PostgreSQL trigger function `forbid_prompt_update()` to prevent prompt modifications
- Attach triggers to all 3 tables: `generation_jobs`, `content_items`, `content_items_auto`
- Implement via SQLAlchemy DDL event listeners (PostgreSQL-only)

### Backend API Updates

#### API Response Models
- Update API models to include `path_thumb` field in responses
- Add `prompt` field to response models but **exclude by default** from list endpoints
- `prompt` field only included in single-item detail endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/content/{id}`)
- Endpoints to update:
  - `/api/v1/content/unified` (Gallery unified endpoint) - exclude `prompt`
  - `/api/v1/content/{id}` (Single content detail) - include `prompt`
  - Any other content item endpoints that return content data

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. View Mode Toggle (Dashboard & Gallery)
- **Location**: Top right corner of page, left of existing settings icon (Gallery only)
- **Icons**:
  - List view: `ViewListIcon` or `FormatListBulletedIcon` (MUI)
  - Grid view: `ViewModuleIcon` or `GridViewIcon` (MUI)
- **Behavior**:
  - Active view highlighted with color (primary color)
  - Inactive view shown in default/muted color
  - Click to toggle between views
  - State persists in localStorage with keys: `gallery-view-mode`, `dashboard-view-mode`
  - Values: `list` or `grid-WIDTHxHEIGHT` (e.g., `grid-480x644`)
  - Default: List view (to preserve current behavior)

#### 2. Grid View Layout
- **Responsive Grid**:
  - Mobile (xs): 1-2 columns
  - Tablet (sm/md): 2-3 columns
  - Desktop (lg): 3-4 columns
  - Large desktop (xl): 4-5 columns
- **Grid Cell**:
  - Default thumbnail size: 480 × 644 pixels
  - Maintain aspect ratio when fitting images
  - Padding/gap between cells: 16px
  - Hover effect: slight elevation/shadow
  - Click: Navigate to full image view

#### 3. Image Rendering Logic
**Priority order**:
1. If `path_thumb` exists: Display thumbnail
2. If `path_thumb` is null but `content_data` exists: Display full image scaled to fit cell
3. If neither exists: Display placeholder icon

**Image Scaling**:
- Use CSS `object-fit: contain` to maintain aspect ratio
- Center images within grid cells
- Max dimensions determined by grid cell size

#### 4. Placeholder Icon
**Primary choice**: `ImageNotSupportedIcon` (MUI)

**Alternative candidates**:
- `BrokenImageIcon` - Indicates missing/broken image
- `ImageIcon` - Generic image placeholder
- `PhotoIcon` - Photo placeholder
- `InsertPhotoIcon` - Insert photo icon
- `HideImageIcon` - Hidden image indicator
- `PhotoLibraryIcon` - Photo library/gallery icon

#### 5. Full Image View Page
- **Route**: `/gallery/:id` (or `/dashboard/:id`)
- **Layout**:
  - Full-size image displayed (from `content_data` path)
  - If image doesn't exist, show placeholder
  - Back button (arrow icon) in top-left corner
  - Browser back button also works (React Router)
- **Metadata Display** (below image):
  - **Prompt** (generation prompt used to create the content)
  - Title
  - Created date
  - Creator name/ID
  - Tags (as chips)
  - Quality score
  - Content type
  - Any other relevant metadata from `item_metadata`

#### 6. Resolution Selector (Future Phase)
- Dropdown attached to grid view icon
- Options: 576×768, 520×698, 480×644, 440×590, 400×537, 360×484, 320×430, 300×403
- Default: 480×644
- Store selection in localStorage
- *Note*: Implementing icon structure now, dropdown in later phase

### Navigation & State Management

#### State Persistence
- View mode (list/grid): `localStorage.setItem('gallery-view-mode', 'list'|'grid')`
- Resolution (future): `localStorage.setItem('gallery-thumbnail-resolution', '480x644')`
- Restore on page load/reload

#### URL Structure
- Gallery list: `/gallery`
- Gallery item detail: `/gallery/:id`
- Dashboard list: `/dashboard` (or just `/`)
- Dashboard item detail: `/dashboard/:id`

### File Structure (New/Modified Files)

#### Backend
- `genonaut/db/schema.py` - Add `path_thumb` field
- Migration file (auto-generated via `make migrate-prep`)

#### Frontend - New Files
- `frontend/src/pages/gallery/GalleryImageView.tsx` - Full image detail page
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardImageView.tsx` - Full image detail page
- `frontend/src/components/gallery/GridView.tsx` - Grid view component (reusable)
- `frontend/src/components/gallery/ImageGridCell.tsx` - Individual grid cell component

#### Frontend - Modified Files
- `frontend/src/pages/gallery/GalleryPage.tsx` - Add view toggle, conditional rendering
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx` - Add view toggle, conditional rendering
- `frontend/src/types/content.ts` (or equivalent) - Add `pathThumb` to type definitions
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` or routes file - Add new routes for image detail views

### Testing Strategy
- Backend: Update API integration tests to verify `path_thumb` field
- Frontend: Update e2e tests for view toggle and grid view interactions
- Test placeholder rendering when images missing
- Test navigation to/from full image view
- Test state persistence across page reloads

### Migration Commands
```bash
make migrate-prep m="Add path_thumb field to content items"
make migrate-demo
make migrate-dev  # If needed
```

## Implementation Status & Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Database schema and backend API fully implemented
  - `path_thumb` field added to content tables
  - `prompt` field added to content tables with immutability triggers
  - All backend API endpoints updated
  - **Test suite fully passing: 438 passed, 100 skipped, 0 failures**
- ✅ **Phase 2 COMPLETE**: Frontend type definitions and infrastructure
- ✅ **Phase 3 COMPLETE**: Gallery page grid view implementation
- ✅ **Phase 4 COMPLETE**: Dashboard page grid view implementation
- ✅ **Phase 5 COMPLETE**: Testing and polish (with acceptable skips for API server/Playwright)
- ✅ **Phase 6.1 COMPLETE**: Multi-resolution thumbnail support
- 🚧 **Remaining**: Manual testing (see `notes/manual-testing-checklist-thumbnails.md`)

### Key Insights & Gotchas

#### Prompt Field Implementation
1. **Immutability Triggers**: PostgreSQL-only feature using DDL event listeners
   - Triggers automatically created on fresh database initialization
   - For existing databases, triggers must be created manually via SQL
   - Function `forbid_prompt_update()` is reused across all 3 tables

2. **Migration Backfill**: Adding NOT NULL field to existing tables requires special handling
   - Auto-generated migration modified to:
     - Add column as nullable with temporary default
     - Backfill existing rows
     - Enforce NOT NULL constraint
     - Remove default value
   - See migration file for exact implementation

3. **Test-Driven Development**: Schema changes require immediate test updates
   - Adding NOT NULL field caused 27 failures + 47 errors initially
   - All test fixtures must be updated to include new required fields
   - Don't skip test updates - maintain TDD principles!

4. **Batch Editing Caution**: Regex-based batch editing can introduce syntax errors
   - Watch for comma placement (before/after comments)
   - Double commas from multiple replacements
   - Always run syntax check after batch edits

#### API Design Decision
- `prompt` field excluded from list endpoints (Gallery, Dashboard) for performance
- `prompt` field only returned on single-item detail endpoints
- This keeps list queries fast and reduces data transfer

### Next Session Tasks
- Start Phase 2: Frontend type definitions and infrastructure
- Focus on Grid View implementation for Gallery page first
- Reuse components for Dashboard page

### Recent Changes (Current Session - Phase 5 & 6.1)

#### 2.2 Utility Functions & Constants
- [x] Create localStorage utility functions for view mode persistence
- [x] Define grid layout breakpoints and column counts
- [x] Define default thumbnail resolution (480×644)
- [x] Define localStorage keys (`gallery-view-mode`, `dashboard-view-mode`)

### Phase 3: Gallery Page - Grid View Implementation

#### 3.1 Grid View Components
- [x] Create `GridView.tsx` component with responsive grid layout
- [x] Create `ImageGridCell.tsx` component
  - [x] Image rendering with fallback logic (thumb → full → placeholder)
  - [x] Image scaling/fitting within cell
  - [x] Hover effects
  - [x] Click handler for navigation
- [x] Add placeholder icon handling (`ImageNotSupportedIcon`)
- [x] Add data-testid attributes for testing

#### 3.2 Gallery Page View Toggle
- [x] Import MUI icons (`ViewListIcon`, `GridViewIcon`)
- [x] Add view mode state with localStorage persistence
- [x] Create view toggle icon buttons in header
  - [x] Position: top right, left of settings icon
  - [x] Active/inactive styling
  - [x] Click handlers
- [x] Add conditional rendering for list vs grid view
- [x] Test view toggle functionality
- [x] Add data-testid attributes for testing

#### 3.3 Gallery Image Detail Page
- [x] Create route for `/gallery/:id` in router
- [x] Create `GalleryImageView.tsx` component
  - [x] Fetch image data by ID
  - [x] Display full-size image (or placeholder if missing)
  - [x] Add back button (arrow icon)
  - [x] Display metadata below image (title, date, creator, tags, quality score)
- [x] Handle navigation from grid cell to detail page
- [x] Test browser back button functionality
- [x] Add data-testid attributes for testing

### Phase 4: Dashboard Page - Grid View Implementation

#### 4.1 Dashboard Grid View
- [x] Add view mode state with localStorage persistence to `DashboardPage.tsx`
- [x] Add view toggle icons (same as Gallery)
- [x] Integrate `GridView` component (reuse from Gallery)
- [x] Add conditional rendering for list vs grid view
- [x] Test view toggle functionality
- [x] Add data-testid attributes for testing

#### 4.2 Dashboard Image Detail Page
- [x] Create route for `/dashboard/:id` in router
- [x] Create `DashboardImageView.tsx` component (similar to Gallery)
  - [x] Fetch image data by ID
  - [x] Display full-size image (or placeholder if missing)
  - [x] Add back button
  - [x] Display metadata below image
- [x] Handle navigation from grid cell to detail page
- [x] Test browser back button functionality
- [x] Add data-testid attributes for testing

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish

#### 5.1 Backend Tests
- [x] Update API integration tests to verify `path_thumb` field in responses
- [x] Test with null/missing `path_thumb` values
- [ ] Run backend test suite: `make test-api` @skipped-until-api-server

#### 5.2 Frontend Unit Tests
- [x] Write unit tests for `GridView` component
- [x] Write unit tests for `ImageGridCell` component
- [x] Write unit tests for view mode persistence utilities
- [x] Test placeholder icon rendering
- [x] Run frontend unit tests: `make frontend-test-unit`

#### 5.3 Frontend E2E Tests
- [x] Update Gallery e2e tests for view toggle
- [x] Test grid view rendering with mock data
- [x] Test navigation to image detail page
- [x] Test back button navigation
- [x] Test view mode persistence (reload page, verify mode retained)
- [x] Update Dashboard e2e tests similarly
- [ ] Run e2e tests: `make frontend-test-e2e` @skipped-until-playwright-webserver

### 6. Additional polish
#### 6.1. additional thumbnail resolutions ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Backend: Implement multiple thumbnail sizes: store in a single JSONB column: `path_thumbs_alt_res`, with keys being resolutions, and values being the paths.
  - [x] Added `path_thumbs_alt_res` field to ContentItemColumns (schema.py)
  - [x] Added `path_thumbs_alt_res` field to ContentResponse (responses.py)
  - [x] Created and ran migration (704ba727e23b)
  - [x] Updated content_service.py to include field in unified content queries
  - [x] Updated content_service.py to return field in result dictionaries
- [x] Frontend: Add resolution dropdown attached to grid view icon
  - [x] Created ResolutionDropdown component
  - [x] Integrated dropdown into GalleryPage (shows when grid view active)
  - [x] Integrated dropdown into DashboardPage (shows when grid view active)
  - [x] Updated ImageGridCell to use resolution-specific thumbnails from path_thumbs_alt_res
  - [x] Resolution selection persists in localStorage as part of viewMode (e.g., 'grid-480x644')
- [x] Frontend and backend testing for this
  - [x] Added backend test: test_path_thumbs_alt_res_included_in_unified_content (test_services.py)
  - [x] All frontend unit tests passing (100 passed, 11 skipped)
  - [x] Backend test passing for path_thumbs_alt_res field



### Tags
- skipped-until-api-server: Full `make test-api` run needs a running uvicorn instance; the harness times out trying to start the API server during pytest session setup.
- skipped-until-playwright-webserver: Playwright's dev server cannot bind to port 4173 in this sandbox (EPERM), so the e2e suite cannot be executed locally.
