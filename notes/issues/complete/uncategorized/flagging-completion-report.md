I've completed Phase 1 with the flagging engine, models, migrations (manually
created in test db due to a pre-existing migration issue), and comprehensive unit
tests. Now I'm working on Phase 2 with the repository layer already created.

Given the scope and length of this task, let me provide you with a summary of what
 has been accomplished and what remains:

Completed

Phase 1: Core Backend Infrastructure âœ…

1. SQLAlchemy Model: Created FlaggedContent model in genonaut/db/schema.py with
all required fields, relationships, and indexes
2. Alembic Migration: Created migration file
ad4d3f733e19_add_flagged_content_table.py (note: can't run via alembic due to
pre-existing ComfyUI migration issue, but manually created table in test database)
3. Gitignore: Added flag-words.txt to .gitignore
4. Flagging Engine: Created genonaut/utils/flagging.py with:
  - load_flag_words(): Load danger words from configuration file
  - tokenize_text(): Tokenize text into words
  - detect_problem_words(): Detect problem words in text
  - calculate_risk_score(): Calculate risk scores using weighted algorithm
  - analyze_content(): Complete content analysis function
  - get_default_flag_words_path(): Helper to find flag words file
5. Unit Tests: Created test/unit/test_flagging_engine.py with 39 tests covering
all functions and edge cases - all tests passing

Phase 2: Repository Layer (In Progress)

6. Repository: Created genonaut/api/repositories/flagged_content_repository.py
with:
  - Full CRUD operations
  - Pagination with filtering (by creator, source, risk score, review status)
  - Bulk delete operations
  - Statistics retrieval

Next Steps

Still to do:
- Service Layer: Business logic for flagging detection and management
- Database Tests: Test repository operations with actual database
- API Routes: REST endpoints
- API Integration Tests: Test full workflows
- Automated Flagging: Hook into content creation
- Test Infrastructure: Create test flag-words.txt and fixtures
- Frontend: Admin UI for managing flagged content
- Documentation: Update README and create detailed guides

Important Notes

1. Migration Issue: There's a pre-existing bug in migration 94bcd3e6ce9d (ComfyUI)
 that prevents running alembic migrations. The flagged_content table has been
manually created in the test database to allow continued development. This is
documented in the spec under "Tags" and "Questions" sections.
2. Spec Document: Created comprehensive specification at notes/flagging.md with
detailed implementation phases, database schema, API endpoints, risk calculation
algorithm, and frontend requirements.
3. Test Database: Table and indexes successfully created in genonaut_test database
 and ready for testing.

Would you like me to continue with Phase 2 (service layer and tests), or would you
 prefer to address the migration issue first?
