> Frontend Grid Work

  - Added reusable gallery grid with skeleton loading and placeholder handling in
  frontend/src/components/gallery/GridView.tsx:1 and frontend/src/components/gallery/
  ImageGridCell.tsx:1, including hover elevation, aspect-ratio scaling, and data-testids
  for every state.
  - Reworked frontend/src/pages/gallery/GalleryPage.tsx:110 to persist view mode in
  localStorage, expose list/grid toggle buttons beside the options icon, and swap
  between the legacy list and the new grid (with navigation into /gallery/:id ready for
  the upcoming detail view).

  Data & Types

  - Propagated thumbnail and content path fields through the domain/API types and
  services (frontend/src/types/domain.ts:18, frontend/src/types/api.ts:24, frontend/
  src/services/gallery-service.ts:72, frontend/src/services/gallery-auto-service.ts:51,
  frontend/src/services/unified-gallery-service.ts:81) so both manual and unified feeds
  surface pathThumb, contentData, and contentType.

  Constants & Persistence

  - Introduced view preference constants and resolution catalog (frontend/src/constants/
  gallery.ts:1), plus storage helpers that validate grid-${resolution} strings before
  reading/writing localStorage (frontend/src/utils/viewModeStorage.ts:1).

  Tests & Docs

  - Updated existing fixtures to satisfy the enriched GalleryItem contract (frontend/
  src/services/__tests__/galleryService.test.ts:30, frontend/src/pages/dashboard/
  __tests__/DashboardPage.test.tsx:70, frontend/src/pages/gallery/__tests__/
  GalleryPage.test.tsx:61) and recorded progress in notes/thumbs.md:486 and notes/
  thumbs.md:500.

  Verification

  - npm run type-check
  - npm run lint (fails: repository-wide ESLint setup is missing several plugin rule
  definitions, and the command logs numerous legacy issues under .vite/deps and existing
  components/tests unrelated to today’s changes).

  Next Steps

  1. Add automated coverage for the new grid/list toggle (Phase 3.2 “Test view toggle
  functionality”).
  2. Implement the gallery item detail route (Phase 3.3).
  3. Address the global ESLint configuration so linting can pass locally.
