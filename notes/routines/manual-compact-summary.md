# Manual compact summary
I'm having trouble compacting you, so can you write me a prompt to hand-off to you that
dooesn't instruct you to do anything, but simply is a good summmary of everything you've
done and any current problems you are aware of in regards to this search feature you have
been working on in this session? my goal is that i'll bring your memory back in time to
when you were at a low context usage, and then ill give you this summary, and it'll load
you up with good context (low token usage) so that we can continue where we left off.
