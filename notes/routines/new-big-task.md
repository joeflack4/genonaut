# SOP - New big task
## What this SOP is
Describes how to proceed with carrying out a large task.

## When to follow this SOP
Please follow this SOP (standard operating procedure) when asked to, or when you determine that you have a big task (
something that has many steps, will take a while to complete, or is high effort).

## Steps
### 1. You are prompted
This will have already happened. The user has assigned you a new big task and asked you to read and follow this document.

### 2. Reading
The user may supply specific reading for you to do. Or you may determine that you need to do some preliminary reading.

### 3. Planning
Create a new `.md` document in `notes/`, and in it, write:
1. A detailed description of the task at hand.
2. A multi-phase list of checkbox tasks. Most large multi-step tasks will likely merit adding one or more of various 
types of tests: (frontend | backend) x (unit | integration / e2e). Large tasks will often include documentation updates 
(maybe a small bit in the README.md, but usually just in docs/). You should lean towards good documentation and test 
coverage for big tasks. 

### 4. Execution
When you're ready to start working on the tasks, follow the SOP outlined in: `notes/routines/iteration.md`
