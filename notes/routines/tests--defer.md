# Defer _tests_ for feature / update
You have been working on a feature. We have decided to defer one or more _tests_ for later. Examine the document that you 
have been working on to implement the feature / update. Does it have any unchecked boxes representing _tests_ to create?

Then, also think if there are any other _tests_ which would be very useful to have for this feature / update, but are not 
otherwise covered by the _tests_ that have been completed thus far (as shown by checked-off boxes in this document), nor 
explicitly planned yet (as shown by unchecked boxes in this document)

Then, for this set of unfinished _tests_ ((i) unchecked boxes, (ii) new ones you just came up with), add a new file 
`FEATURE-NAME.md` to `notes/issues/groupings/tests/`, where you add markdown checkboxes for all these _tests_ to one day 
be added, as well as as much detail as you think is useful about these _tests_. Finally, add a link to this file in 
`notes/issues/groupings/tests/tests.md`.
