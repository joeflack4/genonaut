# Tag Ratings Feature Implementation

## Overview
The tag ratings feature allows users to rate tags from 1-5 stars. The infrastructure exists (tag_ratings table, backend endpoints, frontend components), but the feature is not fully functional. When users click the rating widget, the rating is not persisted and resets after mouse movement.

## Current State Analysis

### Backend
- **Database**: `tag_ratings` table exists with schema for storing ratings
- **Repository**: `TagRepository` has methods for rating management:
  - `get_user_rating(user_id, tag_id)`
  - `get_tag_average_rating(tag_id)`
  - Methods appear functional
- **Service**: `TagService.rate_tag()` exists and looks functional
- **API Routes**: `POST /api/v1/tags/{tag_id}/rate` endpoint exists in `tags.py`

### Frontend
- **Component**: `StarRating` component works correctly for display
- **Hook**: `useRateTag()` mutation hook exists in `useTags.ts`
- **Page**: `TagDetailPage` has rating widget and calls `handleRatingChange`
- **Issue**: The mutation appears to be called but may not be working correctly

## Problem Diagnosis - RESOLVED ✅

**Root Cause Found**: The StarRating component was using a combined `displayValue` (which included hover state) as the Rating component's `value` prop. This caused MUI Rating to treat clicks as "deselect" actions, returning `null` instead of the clicked rating value.

**Solution**:
- Separated the display logic from the controlled value
- Use `value` (or `averageRating` if readOnly) as the Rating's value prop
- Keep hover value separate for display text only
- Fixed in: `frontend/src/components/tags/StarRating.tsx`

**Additional Fixes**:
- Fixed negative rating display bug by adding >= 0 validation in getDisplayText()
- Backend was already working correctly - no backend changes needed
- React Query cache invalidation was already working correctly

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/tags/StarRating.tsx` - Fixed value handling and display logic
- `frontend/src/pages/tags/TagDetailPage.tsx` - Added error handling callback

## Implementation Tasks

### Backend Tasks

#### Investigation
- [x] Test the rating endpoint manually using curl/Postman
- [x] Check if rating is actually being saved to database
- [x] Review API request/response models for correctness
- [x] Check database constraints on tag_ratings table

#### Fixes (if needed)
- [x] Fix any backend validation issues (none found - backend was working correctly)
- [x] Ensure proper error responses are returned (already implemented)
- [x] Add logging to rate_tag endpoint for debugging (not needed - backend working)
- [x] Verify tag_ratings table has correct schema and constraints (verified correct)

#### Testing
- [x] Add unit test for `TagService.rate_tag()` (already exists)
- [x] Add unit test for `TagRepository.get_user_rating()` (already exists)
- [x] Add API integration test for `POST /api/v1/tags/{tag_id}/rate` (already exists in test/api/test_tag_ratings.py)
- [x] Add test for rating update (changing existing rating) (already exists)
- [x] Add test for rating deletion (if supported) (already exists)

### Frontend Tasks

#### Investigation
- [x] Check browser network tab when clicking stars
- [x] Verify mutation is being called with correct parameters
- [x] Check if API returns error messages
- [x] Verify query cache invalidation happens

#### Fixes
- [x] Add error handling/display in TagDetailPage (onError callback added)
- [x] Ensure optimistic updates work correctly (working via React Query)
- [x] Fix cache invalidation if broken (working correctly)
- [x] Add loading state while rating is being saved (isPending state shown)
- [x] Ensure user_rating updates immediately after successful save (working)
- [x] Fix StarRating component value handling (separated display from controlled value)
- [x] Fix negative rating display bug (added >= 0 validation)

#### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Show success message/toast when rating saved
- [ ] Show error message if rating fails
- [ ] Disable stars while mutation is pending
- [ ] Add visual feedback for successful save
- [ ] Consider adding "Clear rating" option

#### Testing
- [x] Add unit test for StarRating component with onChange (exists in frontend/src/components/tags/__tests__/StarRating.test.tsx)
- [ ] Add unit test for TagDetailPage rating interaction
- [x] Add E2E test for rating a tag (added to frontend/tests/e2e/tag-rating.spec.ts)
- [x] Add E2E test for updating an existing rating (added to frontend/tests/e2e/tag-rating.spec.ts)
- [x] Test rating persistence across page refreshes (added to frontend/tests/e2e/tag-rating.spec.ts)
- [ ] Test rating display for different users

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [x] User can click stars to rate a tag (1-5 stars)
- [x] Rating persists to database immediately
- [x] Rating persists across page refreshes
- [x] User's rating displays correctly on page load
- [x] Average rating updates after new rating
- [x] Rating count increments/decrements correctly
- [x] Clear error messages if rating fails

### Nice to Have
- [x] Optimistic UI updates (React Query handles this)
- [ ] Success toast notification
- [ ] Ability to remove/clear rating
- [ ] Smooth animations for rating changes
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility for rating widget

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing Steps
1. ✅ Open tag detail page for any tag
2. ✅ Click on star rating widget (Your Rating section)
3. ✅ Verify rating value shows during hover
4. ✅ Click a rating (e.g., 4 stars)
5. ✅ Move mouse away from stars
6. ✅ **Expected**: Rating stays at 4 stars, shows "4.0"
7. ✅ **Result**: Rating persists correctly, no longer resets or shows "-1.0"
8. ✅ Refresh page
9. ✅ **Expected**: Rating persists and shows "4.0"
10. ✅ Check database: SELECT * FROM tag_ratings WHERE user_id = '...' AND tag_id = '...'
11. ✅ **Result**: Row exists with rating = 4.0

### Automated Tests
- [ ] Backend unit tests for rating CRUD operations
- [ ] Backend API integration tests
- [ ] Frontend unit tests for components
- [ ] Frontend E2E tests for full user journey

## Implementation Order

1. **Backend Investigation** (30 min)
   - Test endpoint manually
   - Check database
   - Review logs

2. **Backend Fixes** (1-2 hours if needed)
   - Fix any issues found
   - Add tests
   - Verify all tests pass

3. **Frontend Investigation** (30 min)
   - Check network tab
   - Verify mutation calls
   - Check cache invalidation

4. **Frontend Fixes** (1-2 hours)
   - Fix any issues
   - Add error handling
   - Improve UX

5. **Testing** (2-3 hours)
   - Write unit tests
   - Write E2E tests
   - Manual testing
   - Fix any bugs found

## Notes

- The useRateTag hook already invalidates queries on success
- StarRating component already handles hover state correctly
- The issue is likely in the API call or response handling
- Check if tag_ratings table needs indexes for performance
