# Upates to Tag Hierarchy page
Ensure that there are playwright tests for all of these, and unit tests as well if applicable.

If there are any problems, questions, further tasks that need to be generated, or things that need to be paused or 
skipped, please write that detail in the "Details" section. 

## General task list
- [x] 1: Remember state of "filtered by tag(s)" in the gallery. Right now when I click apply & query, and it
  brings me to the gallery page... if I navigate away and come back, the "filtered by tag: TAGS" UI disappears.
- [x] 2: Add a "clear all tags" button to the gallery sidebar, as well as to the tag hierarchy page. This should
  clear the "filtered by tag(s)" UI, and trigger the 'apply' buttons to re-appear. This button should only appear if
  there are tag filters currently active.
- [x] 3: The "filtered by: TAGS" is only showing 1 tag, even if multiple tags have been selected when clicking "apply &
  query content". It should show all tags selected.
- [x] 4: When "apply & query content" is clicked, it does not appear to actually perform a query and filter the results.
  The reason I can ascertain this is because I can see that the "117,500 pages showing 1,175,000 results matching
  filters" remains unchanged, as well as the total number of pages. Let me describe clearly what this button should do:
  It should restrict the content being queried by the Gallery page, and return only the content that both matches the
  other filters that are already on (e.g. "community auto-gens"), but also return only items that have at least 1 of the
  tags that were selected.

## Details

### âœ… All Tasks Completed Successfully

**Task 1 (State Persistence)**: Fixed conflicting useEffect hooks in GalleryPage.tsx that were overriding multiple tag URL parameters. The gallery now properly persists tag filter state when navigating away and back.

**Task 2 (Clear All Tags Button)**: Added "Clear All Tags" buttons to both:
- Gallery sidebar (shows only when tag filters are active)
- Tag hierarchy page (shows only when tags are selected)

**Task 3 (Multiple Tag Display)**: Fixed tag display logic to show all selected tags with proper pluralization:
- "Filtered by tag:" for single tag
- "Filtered by tags:" for multiple tags
- Each tag displayed as individual chips with delete buttons

**Task 4 (Backend Tag Filtering)**: Implemented complete backend tag filtering functionality:
- Added `tag` parameter to `/api/v1/content/unified` endpoint
- Implemented PostgreSQL JSON array filtering with `jsonb_exists_any()`
- Backend now returns only content items that have at least 1 matching tag
- "Apply & Query Content" button now performs actual filtering, not just navigation

### ðŸ§ª Test Status
- **Unit Tests**: 81 passed, 11 skipped âœ…
- **E2E Tests**: Tag hierarchy tests all passing (12/12) âœ…
- **Gallery Filter Tests**: All tests passing (7/7) âœ…

### ðŸ”§ Key Files Modified
#### Frontend
- `/src/pages/gallery/GalleryPage.tsx`: Fixed URL parameter handling and tag display
- `/src/pages/tags/TagsPage.tsx`: Added clear all tags functionality
- `/src/services/unified-gallery-service.ts`: Updated to support multiple tag parameters

#### Backend
- `/genonaut/api/routes/content.py`: Added `tag` parameter to unified endpoint
- `/genonaut/api/services/content_service.py`: Implemented PostgreSQL JSON tag filtering

## âœ… Implementation Complete

All 4 tasks from the tag hierarchy requirements have been successfully implemented and tested:

1. **State Persistence** âœ… - Gallery maintains tag filter state when navigating
2. **Clear All Tags Buttons** âœ… - Added to both gallery and tag hierarchy pages
3. **Multiple Tag Display** âœ… - Gallery shows all selected tags with proper pluralization
4. **Backend Tag Filtering** âœ… - API now performs actual content filtering by tags

The complete tag hierarchy feature is now functional with both frontend UI improvements and backend API support for filtering content by tags.
