# Gallery Page Tag Functionality Merge

## Objectives
- [x] Decide on merge strategy for `GalleryPage` and `EnhancedGalleryPage`.
- [x] Consolidate tag-related UI/logic into a single `GalleryPage` implementation.
- [x] Remove legacy enhanced page file and update all imports/routes/tests.
- [x] Verify gallery features and run relevant frontend tests (or document environment constraint).

## Tasks
- [x] Audit existing `GalleryPage.tsx` functionality and identify missing enhanced features.
- [x] Review `EnhancedGalleryPage.tsx` to list components/hooks required for tags sidebar and filtering.
- [x] Implement chosen strategy (rename vs. merge) and ensure TypeScript types/hooks align with current services.
- [x] Update router configuration, exports, and test suites to reference the unified `GalleryPage`.
- [x] Confirm lint/unit checks for affected files or note follow-up if tooling blocked.
- Attempted `npm run test-unit -- GalleryPage.test.tsx`; blocked by sandbox Rollup optional dependency (`@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64`). Python API suites updated and passing.
