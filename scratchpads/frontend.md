# Frontend MVP spec

This document outlines the frontend development approach for Genonaut, including recommended technologies, architecture,
and integration with the FastAPI backend.

## Introduciton
We would like to implement a frontend for our app: genonaut. Right now we have a folder called genonaut, which is 
actually for backend code (Python, SQL, etc). I'd like to put the frontend in its own sibling folder; call it 
`frontend`.

Follow an architecture that follows the outline of this document. But, try to avoid upgrading to anything too advanced 
beyond this, as my dev team does not have advanced React / JavaScript developers, so we'd like to start with something 
that requires more intermediate level ReactJS ability to maintain.

For testing: Do TDD.

The backend API is well documented. See: docs/api.md. Also, Swagger / OpenAPI docs are running on localhost:8000/docs

What do I want the app to do?
This is a sort of recommender system for generative AI. In the future, I'm thinking about various modalities, but right 
now we are going to stick to image generation. We should have some basic common pages, such as login, sign up, and 
user/app settings. There is no authentication right now. So you can just treat it as if the user is already logged in, 
and their name can just be "Admin".

## Current Status

**ðŸš§ Frontend Development Planned**

The backend API is complete and ready for frontend integration

## Technology Recommendations

### Primary Framework

**React + TypeScript**
- **Libraries:** React Query (API integration), Material-UI

### Development Stack

**Build Tools:**
- **NPM** - Package manager
- **Vite** - Fast build tool with excellent TypeScript support
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code quality and formatting
- **Vitest** - Unit testing framework
- **PlayWright** - End-to-end testing framework. 
  - Pair with @playwright/test runner (already included in Playwright).

**API Integration:**
- **Axios or Fetch** - HTTP client for API requests
- **React Query / TanStack Query** - Data fetching and caching
- **OpenAPI Generator** - Auto-generate TypeScript types from API schema

**Styling:**
- **Component Library** - Material-UI

**State Management:**
- **React Context + useReducer** (for React)

## Architecture Overview

```

### API Integration Layer

**Service Layer Pattern:**
```typescript
// services/api.ts
export class ApiClient {
  private baseURL = process.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000';
  
  async get<T>(endpoint: string): Promise<T> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`);
    return response.json();
  }
  
  async post<T>(endpoint: string, data: any): Promise<T> {
    const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    return response.json();
  }
}

// services/userService.ts
export class UserService {
  constructor(private api: ApiClient) {}
  
  async getUser(id: number): Promise<User> {
    return this.api.get<User>(`/api/v1/users/${id}`);
  }
  
  async createUser(userData: UserCreateRequest): Promise<User> {
    return this.api.post<User>('/api/v1/users', userData);
  }
}
```

**Type Safety with OpenAPI:**
```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from API
npx openapi-typescript http://localhost:8000/openapi.json --output src/types/api.ts
```

## Core Features to Implement

### MVP Feature Set

**1. User Management Interface**
Overview:
- User registration and profile management
- User preferences configuration

This will be its own section with 1+ pages.

**2. Content Browser**
Right now the only content will be images. And there is metadata about those images.

Overview:
- Content listing with pagination and filtering
- Content detail views
- Content search functionality

This will be its own section with 1+ pages.

This app is high throughput. A typical user will likely have several thousand images of their own that they have used AI
to generate, and after doing so, they will come here to browse the results, rate, and tag them. They should be able to 
see the images as well as their metadata. They should be able to update certain metadata, such as the rating 
(quality_score in the db), tags, title, and is_private status. Obviously some certain fields and operations will require
user ownership in order for the user to make changes. For example, they won't be able to change the title of images 
created by another user, or the average rating shown for the item, or is_private status or the public tags for such 
items, but they can add their own personal tags and their own rating to an item that is not owned by them (I still need
to implement that on the backend). If they have ownership of an item, they can do all these changes, including delete
the item. The user should also be able to do filtering: tags (multiple select), rating (1 - 10) (the backend currently
has this as as a 0 to 1 scale, but that will change). And, the user should also be able to filter based searching for
prompts that match a text query. There will be a text box for that. Then, there will be some toggles: "match on
inclusion of any word", "match on inclusion of all words", "match on inclusion of only quoted words", "match on general
similarity". This should be a dropdown menu, with "match on general similarity" being the default.

Ater any filters are aplied, images can be sorted by date or popularity (rating).

**3. Recommendation Display**
- Personalized recommendation feed
- Recommendation explanation/reasoning
- Recommendation feedback collection

This will be a subsection of the "Content browser" section. The user should be able to see content that are personalized
recommendations vs content that is not.

The overall content browser should let the user see content of the following kinds of major categories:
- Global: Not recommended; just browsing by global catelog, which can further be filtered by tags.
- Recommended based on solid user preferences.
- Recommended based on exploring the users preference space.
- Recommended based on preferences of similar users.
- Recommended based on exploring the preference space f similar users.

**4. Generation**
This will be its own section with 1+ pages.

Later, this section will have lots of options, but for now, it will not have a lot. There will be a "Generate" button 
(green). When it is activated, there should be some status UI saying "generating". If generating is active, then the 
normally green "generate" button should instead be red and say "Stop". The page should have an integer input field for 
"batch size". The default should be 200, and max should be 1,000,000. Minimum should be 1. There should be a section 
called "Exploration options", for which there will be the following toggles: "Novel (based on my preferences)", "Novel 
(based on users like me)", "Novel (popular preferences)", "Stuff I'll probably like (based on my preferences)", "Stuff 
I'll probably like (based on users like me)", and ""Stuff I'll probably like (popular preferences)". Actually, I guess 
these labels are kind of redundant, so perhaps you can make this a table of checkboxes, with "Novel" and "Stuff I'll 
probably like" as row labels, and "Based on my preferences", "Based on users like me", and "Popular preferences" as the 
column headers.

**5. Interaction Tracking**
- Automatic interaction tracking (views, clicks)
- Rating and feedback components
- User interaction history

Unsure where to put these parts in the app; just know we want them.

**6. System Dashboard**
Overview:
- Global statistics visualization
- System health monitoring
- Basic analytics charts

This will be its own section with 1+ pages.

## Component Design System

### Base Components

**Form Components:**
```typescript
// Button component with variants
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  loading?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick: () => void;
}

// Input component with validation
interface InputProps {
  label: string;
  type: 'text' | 'email' | 'password' | 'number';
  value: string;
  onChange: (value: string) => void;
  error?: string;
  required?: boolean;
}
```

- `UserStats` - User statistics component
- `UserPreferences` - Preferences configuration form

## State Management

### Global State Structure

```typescript
interface AppState {
  user: {
    currentUser: User | null;
    preferences: UserPreferences | null;
    isAuthenticated: boolean;
  };
  content: {
    items: Content[];
    currentContent: Content | null;
    filters: ContentFilters;
    pagination: PaginationState;
  };
  recommendations: {
    items: Recommendation[];
    loading: boolean;
    lastUpdated: Date | null;
  };
  ui: {
    theme: 'light' | 'dark';
    sidebarOpen: boolean;
    notifications: Notification[];
  };
}
```

### Data Fetching Strategy

**React Query Example:**
```typescript
// hooks/useUsers.ts
export function useUsers(filters?: UserSearchParams) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['users', filters],
    queryFn: () => userService.searchUsers(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
}

export function useCreateUser() {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: userService.createUser,
    onSuccess: () => {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['users'] });
    },
  });
}
```

## Routing

### Route Structure

```typescript
// App.tsx or router configuration
const routes = [
  { path: '/', component: HomePage },
  { path: '/content', component: ContentBrowser },
  { path: '/content/:id', component: ContentDetail },
  { path: '/content/create', component: ContentCreate },
  { path: '/recommendations', component: RecommendationFeed },
  { path: '/profile', component: UserProfile },
  { path: '/dashboard', component: Dashboard },
  { path: '/search', component: SearchPage },
];
```

### Navigation Structure

```typescript
// Navigation menu items
const navigationItems = [
  { label: 'Home', path: '/', icon: 'home' },
  { label: 'Content', path: '/content', icon: 'content' },
  { label: 'Recommendations', path: '/recommendations', icon: 'recommend' },
  { label: 'Profile', path: '/profile', icon: 'user' },
  { label: 'Dashboard', path: '/dashboard', icon: 'dashboard' },
];
```

## Integration with Backend API

### API Client Configuration

```typescript
// config/api.ts
export const apiConfig = {
  baseURL: import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8000',
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
};

// Axios interceptors for error handling
axios.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Handle authentication errors
      redirectToLogin();
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
// utils/errorHandling.ts
export class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public status: number,
    public details?: any
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'ApiError';
  }
}

export function handleApiError(error: any): ApiError {
  if (error.response) {
    return new ApiError(
      error.response.data.detail || 'An error occurred',
      error.response.status,
      error.response.data
    );
  }
  return new ApiError('Network error', 0);
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Framework Setup: Vitest

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
    globals: true,
  },
});

// src/test/setup.ts
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import { server } from './mocks/server';

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

### Component Testing

```typescript
// components/__tests__/ContentCard.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { ContentCard } from '../ContentCard';

test('renders content card with title', () => {
  const mockContent = {
    id: 1,
    title: 'Test Content',
    content_type: 'text',
    creator_id: 1,
    is_public: true,
  };

  render(<ContentCard content={mockContent} />);
  
  expect(screen.getByText('Test Content')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### API Mocking (if / as needed)

```typescript
// test/mocks/handlers.ts
import { rest } from 'msw';

export const handlers = [
  rest.get('/api/v1/users/:id', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        id: 1,
        username: 'testuser',
        email: 'test@example.com',
        is_active: true,
      })
    );
  }),
  
  rest.get('/api/v1/content', (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(
      ctx.json({
        items: [],
        total: 0,
        skip: 0,
        limit: 10,
      })
    );
  }),
];
```

### Testing Framework: Playwright
TODO: add information regarding set up, commands, workflows, etc.

      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          router: ['react-router-dom'],
          api: ['axios', '@tanstack/react-query'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```
