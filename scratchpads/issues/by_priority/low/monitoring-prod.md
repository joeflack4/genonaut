### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

#### Core Metrics: Prometheus/Grafana + SaaS for Critical Features
**Pros:**
- Cost optimization (keep bulk metrics self-hosted)
- Use SaaS for specialized features (error tracking, user monitoring)
- Maintain control over core performance data
- Best of both worlds

**Cons:**
- More complex setup
- Multiple tools to maintain
- Potential data correlation challenges

## Recommended Course of Action

**For production: DataDog APM with strategic self-hosted components**

### Why This Approach:

1. **Operational Efficiency**: Focus on product development, not monitoring infrastructure
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Application, infrastructure, database, and user monitoring
3. **Proven Reliability**: Battle-tested by thousands of companies
4. **Advanced Features**: Anomaly detection, intelligent alerting, incident management
5. **Database Insights**: Critical for pagination performance optimization

    integrations=[
        FastApiIntegration(auto_enable=True),
        SqlalchemyIntegration(),
    ],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

```

## Cost Analysis

### DataDog Costs (estimated)
- **APM**: ~$31/host/month for full features
- **Infrastructure**: ~$15/host/month
- **Logs**: ~$1.50/GB ingested
- **RUM**: ~$0.60/1000 sessions
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: ~$5/10K tests

### Typical Monthly Cost for Small Production Deployment:
- 2-3 hosts: ~$100-150/month
- Log ingestion (50GB): ~$75/month
- RUM (100K sessions): ~$60/month
- **Total**: ~$235-285/month

### ROI Justification:
