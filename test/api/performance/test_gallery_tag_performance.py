"""Performance test for gallery tag query against live demo server.

This test validates that the canonical tag query completes within acceptable time limits.
It tests against the running demo server on port 8001.

IMPORTANT: This test expects the demo server to ALREADY BE RUNNING on port 8001.
It does NOT start its own test server. Start the demo server with: make api-demo

These tests are marked with @pytest.mark.performance and @pytest.mark.manual,
so they will NOT run during regular test suite execution.

Run manually with:
